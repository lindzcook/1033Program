For the heatmap, we used the NYT's data, (also available on Github,)[https://github.com/TheUpshot/Military-Surplus-Gear] because it included county for both tactical and non-tactical items and the data we were given by LESO did not.

We ran additional analysis for the story using the LESO data included this repo.
